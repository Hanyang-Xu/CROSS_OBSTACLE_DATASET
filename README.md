# CROSS_OBSTACLE_DATASET
***
## INTRODUCTION
Understanding what changes people make in order to **cross obstacles of different heights** is useful for designing wearable robots such as prosthetics and exoskeletons. However, previous studies have not systematically analyzed the changes in biomechanics as people cross obstacles of different heights. This dataset collected biomechanical data from 10 subjects *(6 men and 4 women, with an average age of around 20 years)* while crossing obstacles of different heights.
